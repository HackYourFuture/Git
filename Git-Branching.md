# Git branching homework: 

* Use the https://github.com/unmeshvrije/hyfclass repository for this homwork.
* Clone the repository (Research how to clone)
* Send me `Github user name` so that I will give you _write_ access to the repository.
* Make a branch. 
* Name it `Github user name-dev` 
* Create a file commands.txt in your branch.
* Add bash commands that you like. Add description for commands.
* Then git add, commit and push them in a remote branch.

* **Do not merge the changes to master branch**.
* **Do not make any changes to master branch**.
